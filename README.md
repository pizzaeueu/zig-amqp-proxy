## First Impression on ZIG
- Didn't use the language without GC for a while, really excited to give a try
- Build tool / code formatter is a part of the language is quite interesting
- Need to understand test philosophy

- Generated simple hello world using `zig init`
- My way to learn things is: cycle of practice and theory with gradual dive step by step, so I want to start with something as a first step
- Found an artical 'bout low level tcp implementation on zig, so will follow it


===
- `zig build run`
- `zig build test`
- `zig fmt`
